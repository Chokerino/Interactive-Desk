 	<h3 class="intro">Even in 2019 the majority of the desk clocks available are the still same boring stuff they were many years ago and to change this we decided to build a smart desk clock with a build in gaming system and a personal assistant. Our system includes the boring little clock for when your studying but for when the work time ends it has loads of emulators built in and all you need to do is insert your ROMS into it and enjoy the best games of your childhood.</h3>
