    <h1>Interactive Holographic Gaming Desk</h1>

 	<h3 class="intro">Even in 2019 the majority of the desk top appliances available are the still same boring stuff as they were many years ago and to change this we decided to build a smart desk with a build in gaming system and a personal assistant. Our system includes the boring little clock for when your studying but when the work ends it has loads of emulators built-in and all you need to do is insert your ROMS into it and enjoy the best games of your childhood and some arcade nostalgia.</h3>

    <h3 class="sktch">Our early ideas for this project included a Plant Growing Environment which automatically supplies nutirents and appropriate sunlight depending upon the species of the plant. Another idea was a Car Collision Safety System which would send out information to nearby hospitals in case of accidents. We did not choose to go through with these ideas because of lack of funding being provided on top of the high expectations being put forward. Also, due to lack of clarity of what all can be done (The idea of lightsaber and a lamp being ok but plant growth system being not good for grades) created confusion so we ended up creating what was basic and the best.
