    <div class="Intro">
    Pedestrians face a costant risk of being involved in accidents because of lack of safety technologies for them. The constant need to look down at ones phone to see the directions poses some danger and to overcome that we have come up with a heads-up display being fitted in a cap which will show directions. This provides easy and important information in front of one`s eyes while also protecting one from sunlight.
