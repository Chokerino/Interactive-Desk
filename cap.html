    <h1>Pedestrian Navigator Cap</h1>

    <div class="Intro">
    Pedestrians face a costant risk of being involved in accidents because of lack of safety technologies for them. The constant need to look down at ones phone to see the directions poses some danger and to overcome that we have come up with a heads-up display being fitted in a cap which will show directions. This provides easy and important information in front of one`s eyes while also protecting one from sunlight.

    The cap is designed such that the screen does not obsruct vision while providing directions along with instructions for ease. We are currently using Open Route Service API but with proper funding we will use Google Maps API which provides better street navigation in India and also will allow us to choose destination from our mobiles.
